	<p style="font-family:Helvetica;margin-left:100px;margin-right:100px;">Hello! My name is ScoutYes (J. Kay). I am writing a book called "The Mydanvel" which you can read about below! I love writing stories and get many ideas from books I read such as Septimus Heap and Fablehaven.
		<br><Br>
		The Mydanvel Book is an up and coming book
		predicted to fully release by Summer 2021! The Book will be about a group  that go on many missions that take them around the world. Their adventures take them to many places sent by a group of people to protect peace between the "Beings", which are an ancient living species that are trying to gain control of the world after many millions of years of silence, and Humans.
		<br><br>
		I will be live streaming some weekends writing the book! I will also take suggestions and interact with my community (buttons below!)
